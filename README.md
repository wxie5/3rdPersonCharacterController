# 3rdPersonCharacterController

small visual issue: when you enter the scene, you will see the character is grabing a axe, but that does not mean the character is truely grabing a weapon, you need to press Left Arrow Key or Right Arrow Key to switch weapon 
 
WASD for movement
Mouse for camera rotation
Left/Right Arrow Key for switching weapon
Mouse Left Click for attack (when you grab a weapon)
Space for roll
Q for locking on the target (the sphere in the scene)
